------------------------ General Help for "remora/$VER" -------------------------

REMORA is an easy-to-use monitor that statistical and timeline information
of resources used for a running application. The collected information included:

    - CPU usage
    - Memory usage
    - MPI usage
    - I/O load (Lustre, DVS)
    - NUMA memory
    - Network topology

A summary of resource usage is provided at the end of the output file.

REMORA also puts timeline results in a directory names remora_<jobid>. 
Subdirectories are named according to the resource (MPI, IO, CPU, etc.).

Timeline information is recorded in txt files of the remora_<jobid> directory.
Timeline information is also reported in html files, also found in the 
remora_<jobid> directory. (Download the remora_<jobid> directory and open
the remora_summary.html to get a page with links (and labels) to all of
the html plot pages.  You can also simply cat an html file of interest,
copy and paste the page into a file on your local laptop, and open it 
to see the timeline plots.

To generate a summary report after a crash use:

remora_post_crash <jobid>.
