# Contributing to REMORA

1. REMORA is open source and it's going to stay like that.
2. Nobody really owns it. Any good and reasonable feedback or feature is included in REMORA. If you want to extend the functionality without telling us, go ahead, clone the repo and do it.
3. Most suggestions are welcome. If you have a great idea, or a new request, or a new piece of hardware that provides great functionality and can be monitored, open a new Issue. If you can add a new module to monitor that new hardware, great. If not, please describe in the Issue how to proceed.
4. This is software and it has bugs. And that's great. If you find a bug, open an Issue.
5. Add Tags to the issues so that it's easy to identify if it's a bug, a proposed enhancement of the code, or whatever you think it is.
6. If you use it, please cite it. C. Rosales, A. GÃ³mez-Iglesias, A. Predoehl. "REMORA: a Resource Monitoring Tool for Everyone". DOI: 10.1145/2834996.2834999
